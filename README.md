# Number Operations using Friend Function and Operator Overloading
- Takes two numbers as input
- Calculates their sum
- Calculates their subtraction
- Multiplies the obtained results 
    - (Concepts Used)
- Classes and Objects
- Friend Function
- Operator Overloading 
    - (Output)
fixed value of a and b
1 1
paramteric value
2 4
Added value
3 5
subtracted value
-1 -3
multiplied value
-3 -15

# String check using Operator Overloading
The program stores a message in a string and checks whether the user has entered a message or not.
         -(Concepts Used)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Operator Overloading
- String handling
        - (Working)
- If no message is entered, the program displays: "no message entered"
- Otherwise, it displays: "User entered a Message"
        - (output)
  case1:                                   case2:
default message                            default message                            
Hi                                         Hi
User Message                               User message
no message entered                         Hello world
                                           User entered a Message
